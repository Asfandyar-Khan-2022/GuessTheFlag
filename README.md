# GuessTheFlag
The game works by displaying three flags to the user out of a fixed set of flags.
The flags are in random order every time they are displayed.
The user is promted to pick a flag that corresponds with the displayed flag name.
If the answer is correct then the score is incremented by 1.
Otherwise, the wrong score is incremented by one. 
The game continues until the user identifies 8 flags correctly.
At which point the user can reset the game or continue for another round.
